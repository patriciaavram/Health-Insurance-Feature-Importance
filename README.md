# Health Insurance Feature Importance Analysis Using XGBoost

This project builds a predictive model for hospital charges for a given patient from a U.S. health insurance dataset. A feature importance analysis is first performed to classify the patients into various clusters given how various factors, such as age, BMI, smoking status, etc. influence the costs of their hospital charges, and therefore the cost of health insurance claims. 

This project uses the U.S. Health Insurance [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teertha/ushealthinsurancedataset), from Kaggle.
